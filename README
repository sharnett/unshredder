shred.m takes an array of image data and a desired slice thickness, and returns
an image array shredded into slices of that thickness

detectthickness.m takes a shredded image array and uses autocorrelation (black

unshred.m takes a shredded image array and a thickness, and unshuffles the image.
It models it as an assignment problem and solves it with a standard LP solver.

sean.m is a simple script that shows all the pieces in action
